A focused CUDA course on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using the multidomain Schwarz method.

## Overview

This course is designed for C++ developers looking to leverage CUDA for efficient PDE solving using the Schwarz method, a Jacobi-block approach for multidomain problems.

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of C++
- Basic knowledge of PDEs and numerical methods
- Familiarity with parallel computing concepts

## Course Structure

### Part 1: CUDA Fundamentals

Based on "Learn CUDA Programming: A Beginner's Guide to GPU Programming":

- CUDA programming model and GPU architecture
- Memory management in CUDA
- Parallel reduction and optimization techniques

### Part 2: PDE Solving with Schwarz Method

Custom curriculum focusing on:

- Implementation of the Schwarz method in CUDA
- Domain decomposition techniques
- Parallel iterative solvers for subdomains
- Inter-domain communication and synchronization
- Performance optimization for PDE solving

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, I expect to be able to:

1. Implement the Schwarz method for PDEs using CUDA
2. Optimize CUDA code for efficient multidomain PDE solving
3. Apply domain decomposition techniques in parallel environments
4. Develop high-performance scientific simulations using GPU acceleration
